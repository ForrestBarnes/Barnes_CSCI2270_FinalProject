Hey there Forrest!!
   This project you made is rather cool. Seems like a simple management program on the outside, but the inside is more complex than I was 
prepared for. I'm still mostly a novice at C++, but I can pull my own. Anyway, I didn't find any bugs, so I added a simple company name feature
to your code. Now when the program starts, it prompts the user for a company name before the CEO's name. The company name will appear when the
organization structure is printed; it will also appear above the CEO's name when the file is exported. When importing a file, the first
line should be the company name without a comma then the second line is the CEO's name. I also changed the file import to account for c-strings
instead of strings. This makes your program work on older versions of c++, because the file.open() function needs c-strings on older versions.
Your program is unchanged other than that.
Cheers,
   Alex H.
